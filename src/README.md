# Source code

In this directory, you will find the code used to produce the different results displayed in our submission.

These results can be consulted directly in the "*results*" folder of the repository.

In order to replicate our experiments, you will need to **run the Main.ipynb** file in this directory.

Additional scripts are available in the "*others*" directory, as:
- *Analyze_data.ipynb*, a first notebook to discover the data
- *Analyse_interactions.ipynb*, a notebook useful to depict the feature importances of interactions between the run-time configuration options and the compile-time configuration options
- *Clean_data.ipynb*, a notebook to process and clean the data
- *Interplay - main notebook.py* and *Interplay - main notebook.md*, a python script and a markdown corresponding to the main notebook
- Old copies of the main notebook (not useful)
